                <p> Owl-bert is the affectionate nickname I gave to this Athenian inspired owl school mascot. The brief instructed to create a custom illustrated owl mascot that unites students in school pride. Students voted on an owl as their mascot and were asked to submit drawings as inspiration. 
                </p>
                <p>The drawings submitted by Calvert students, as well as an illustrated owl character used in worktexts for the early elementary students, kick-started the design process. The worktext character wears black rimmed glasses, while student sketches included owls with graduation caps and world globes. The initial concepts for Owl-bert did not emulate traditional mascots leading me to take more creative license with my next round of concepts. 
                </p>
                <p>Instead of designing a full owl, I did a study of wings and another of heads/faces. This allowed me to more quickly experiment and envision combinations. From there I sketched full bodied owls in various poses and digitally illustrated the most promising sketches. After several rounds of edits, Owl-bert was born.</p>
