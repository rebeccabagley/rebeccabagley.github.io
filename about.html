                  I'm a designer who enjoys custom illustration, typography, and story-telling. I've worked as a graphic designer for print and web; as a publication designer for education materials; and as a pre-press designer. A few favorite projects I've worked on are a custom-illustrated high school mascot, a K-2 scope and sequence catalog, and an encouraging lyric t-shirt. Check them out on my portfolio page! I am available to work on a variety of projects, including custom illustration and design for apparel, business cards and logos, posters and flyers, social media graphics, and website UX/UI design. 
                  <br>When I'm not designing, you can find me hanging out with my cats, cooking vegetarian food, or fueling my coffee obsession.
